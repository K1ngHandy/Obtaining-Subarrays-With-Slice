    PROBLEM 3:
    Using slice, log to the console an array that only includes the two elements in the middle of the above array named originalArray so the output should be [2, 3]

    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): 
    The following code is throwing this error: "TypeError: numbers.slice is not a function". Fix the error so that the console prints “12345”.
    let numbers = 1234567;
    console.log(numbers.slice(-1, 5));
